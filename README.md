Project 1 - Making Time.

Description: Making Time is a simple calendar application that can be used in any way the user desires. I envisioned it to be a platform in which users can quickly make plans for the weekend or later in the evening. The events on the calendar behave like chat rooms, instead of rigid forms/timesheets.

User Stories:
    -as a user, i want to be able to create a simple user profile. logging in will be necessary in order to access my calendar.
    -as a user, i want to be able to create a new calendar and share it with other users of my choosing.
    -as a user, i want to be able to create and edit content/events on my calendar.

Libraries: Moment.js, Underscore.js, Bootstrap, jQuery

Future Development: I hope to add some key features that will make the application viable for use. I want users to be able to create multiple calendars, share calendars with other users, and control privacy/user settings for each calendar. I would like to implement sockets.io in order for the events to behave more like chatrooms. I would also like to implement invitation capabilities.
